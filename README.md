## Overview

The **Online Shop** project is a demo e-commerce application designed for Hackathon Phase 1. It serves as a platform to showcase best practices in code quality, development workflows, and system design with a focus on:

- **Git & GitHub:** Effective version control, branching strategies, and collaborative workflows.
- **Linux:** Command-line operations, system administration, and file management.
- **Docker:** Principles of containerization and preparing code for deployment in a containerized environment.

Your task is to familiarize yourself with the code, make enhancements if necessary, and ensure your final submission reflects your understanding of these topics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### üîß Git & GitHub Operations

- **Repository Management:**
  - **Forked** the repository and **cloned** it locally.
  - Created a feature branch `feature/docker-integration` to isolate enhancements.
  
  ```bash
  -git clone https://github.com/dvharsh/online_shop_hackathon.git
  -cd online_shop_hackathon
  -git checkout -b feature/docker-integration

### Environment Setup & Dependency Installation:

### Installed project dependencies:

-npm install

### Version Control & Collaboration:

-Maintained a clean commit history using descriptive messages:

-git add .
-git commit -m "feat: initial setup and dependency installation"
-git push origin feature/docker-integration
-Created Pull Requests for code reviews and future merging.

### Vite Configuration:

- Updated vite.config.js to set the development server‚Äôs host and port:

-import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
-import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

-export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: './',
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',  // Accessible externally üåê
    port: 5173,
    strictPort: true,
  },
  css: {
    devSourcemap: false,
  },
});


### üêß Linux Environment & Optimizations

--File Permissions:
-Updated file permissions for enhanced security:

-chmod -R 755 public src node_modules
-chmod 644 package.json vite.config.js index.html README.md CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE ROADMAP.md

--Command-Line Proficiency:
- Verified file operations (e.g., ls, mv, cp) and ensured proper functioning of system scripts.


-- Process Management with PM2:
- Installed and configured PM2 to run the application in the background:
- sudo npm install -g pm2
- pm2 start "npm run dev" --name online-shop
- pm2 save
- pm2 startup

This setup ensures the application remains running even after closing the terminal.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Vite/React Configuration
-The application is built using Vite and React.
-The build process outputs the production-ready files into a dist folder, which are later served by Nginx in the Docker container.


### üê≥ Docker Containerization
-.dockerignore File:

-Created a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the build context:

-dockerignore
node_modules
.git
dist
*.log
Dockerfile
.dockerignore

-- Implemented a multi-stage Dockerfile to build the app and serve it using Nginx:

# Stage 1: Build the application using Node 18
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


### Docker Compose Configuration:

-- Developed a docker-compose.yml file to manage container settings including port mapping, healthchecks, and volume for backup:

version: "3.8"
services:
  online-shop:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: dvharsh/online-shop:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:80"  # Map host port 3000 to container port 80
    volumes:
      - shop_backup:/usr/share/nginx/html  # Persistent backup of built files
    restart: always
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s

volumes:
  shop_backup:
    driver: local


##Pushing to Docker Hub:

-- Built and pushed the final Docker image to Docker Hub:

docker login
docker push dvharsh/online-shop:latest


### üöÄ How to Run the Application Development (On EC2)

-Clone the Repository & Switch Branch:

git clone https://github.com/dvharsh/online_shop_hackathon.git
cd online_shop_hackathon
git checkout -b feature/final-phase1

-- Install Dependencies:

npm install

-- Start the Development Server:

npm run dev

-- Access the Application:

-Use the configured port in vite.config.js (e.g., accessible externally).

-- Production (Using Docker)
-Build the Docker Image with Compose:

docker-compose build --no-cache

-- Run the Container:

docker-compose up -d

-- Access the Application: Open your browser at:

-http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000
-Replace <EC2_PUBLIC_IP> with your EC2 instance's public IP address.

## Guidelines & Resources

Before diving into the tasks, please review the following key resources:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Guidelines for code contributions, commit messages, and overall coding standards.
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md): Insights into the project vision, future enhancements, and milestones.
- **Repository Documentation:** Explore the repository to understand how the application is built. Pay special attention to the `src` directory where the main application logic resides, as well as configuration files such as `vite.config.js` and styling in `index.css`.

These documents provide the context needed to understand the project requirements and the best practices expected for your contributions.

## Tasks

For this hackathon phase, your work will center around the following tasks:

### Git & GitHub

- **Repository Management:** Fork and clone the repository, then create a new branch for your work. Ensure your commit history is clean and well-documented.
- **Collaboration Practices:** Follow best practices for version control by making descriptive commits, creating pull requests, and engaging in code reviews.
- **Workflow Optimization:** Identify any areas where the Git workflow can be improved and document your suggestions for future enhancements.

### Linux

- **Command Line Proficiency:** Review the code for examples of Linux command usage. Test and verify that file operations, system scripts, and environment configurations are functioning as expected.
- **System Administration:** Examine how the application handles Linux-based operations such as permissions, file management, and process monitoring. If you see room for improvement, implement those changes and document them.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document any Linux-related enhancements you make, explaining how they optimize the project‚Äôs performance or usability.

### Docker

- **Containerization Principles:** Even though a Dockerfile is not provided in this repository, consider how you would package and deploy this application using Docker. Reflect on the design decisions that would facilitate containerization.
- **Conceptual Improvements:** Propose any modifications or improvements that could make future Docker integration smoother. Document your suggestions clearly in your pull request.
- **Code Readiness:** Ensure the codebase is structured in a way that aligns with Docker best practices, preparing it for eventual containerized deployment on AWS EC2 / Azure VM / Google Compute Engine (Your Choice of Cloud).
